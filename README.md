# 🧠 Brain Tumor Segmentation using YOLOv11 + SAM2

This project is part of my Machine Learning internship and focuses on advanced medical image segmentation. It combines the speed of **YOLOv11** for tumor localization with the precision of **Meta AI’s Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2)** to segment brain tumors in MRI scans.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **YOLOv11** for real-time object detection of tumor regions in MRI scans.
- ✂️ **SAM2** for pixel-perfect segmentation of the detected tumor areas.
- 📷 Visual results with bounding boxes + segmented masks.
- ✅ Built using Ultralytics, and SAM2 toolkit.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)**
- **SAM2 (Segment Anything Model v2)**
- Google Colab for experimentation
